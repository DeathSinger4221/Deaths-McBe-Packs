# Floating Text
  [<img src="https://github.com/DeathSinger4221/Deaths-McBe-Packs/raw/main/thumbnails/floatingTexts.png?raw=true" width="600">]()

  A **simple** behavior pack that adds a **Floating Text Menu** and Floating Texts to your game. Using the menu you can place new texts and manage existing ones.

  No experimental toggles needed!

# Floating Text Menu

  To make the Floating Text Menu UI appear, you right-click/use the **Floating Text Menu** item. You will be greeted with 2 options:

### Create Floating Text
  Here you enter the text that should be displayed and its position in the world. When you submit, it will summon a new Floating Text using the given information.

  Note: You can use `\n` to have multiline floating texts.

### Find Text by Name
  Here you can search for a specific floating text that already exists in your world by it's Text Content, and manage it by changing the displayed text, changing the text's location or entirely removing the floating text entity.

# Imporatant
  This pack uses entities for the floating texts. So they are susceptible to the ``/kill`` command. The pack uses the ``minecraft:egg`` projectile entity as its base, but it does not interfere with the way the vanilla egg projectile functions, it justs uses the same entity.
  So if your texts are being removed/killed, check for any /kill command blocks
