# Teleportation Items

  This is a behavior pack that adds  a **TP Menu** *(teleportation menu)* that allows you to send tp requests to other players asking them if you are allowed to teleport to them. *(tpr - tpa system)*, and adds a **marker system** for world admins to mark down important locations to which anyone can teleport to! Some markers can be set so only staff can tp to them!

  No Experimental Toggles needed!

# Obtaining the TP Menu

  You can craft a TP Menu out of a stick

# TP Menu

  To make the TP Menu UI appear, you right-click/use the **TP Menu** item. *(Can be found in the Nature Section of the Creative Menu)*

### Send out a TP Request
  Allows you to select a specific player that is online at the moment and send them a request so you can teleport to them.

### Your outgoing request
  Here will appear the TP Request that you have send to an other player. You can only have one outgoing request at a time. Since having multiple doesn't have any use, you can only be at one location at a time. And that as well prevents players from sending requests to eveyone.

### Manage incoming requests
  Here go the TP requests that other players send to you, you can chose which to deny and to accept. When accepted, that player will **teleport to you.**

### TP to a Marker
  Here every marker that is set in the world and that you have permission to teleport to, will be listed and you will be teleported to the selected marker.

### TP to Respawnpoint
  This will teleport you to your respawnpoint, but if none present it will teleport you to the worldspawnpoint.

### Manage Markers
  Here you can set, remove and move Markers but you need the `tpiManager` tag *(Tag can be changed in the config file)* to unlock the **Manage Markers** button in the TP Menu as shown below.

  When clicked, it will list every marker set in the world, say if it's a private marker or not and give you the option to create more.
  If you click on an existing marker, you will have to possibilty to change any information about the marker or even delete it.

# Movement Countdown

  When teleporting with the Menu to a marker or respawn point, you will need to stay still for a certain amout of time like set in the config file. Default is 5 seconds.
  Players with the manager tag however do not need to wait and their teleports are instant.
