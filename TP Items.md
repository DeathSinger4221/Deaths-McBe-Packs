# Teleportation Items and Warp Commands
  This is a behavior pack that adds two new custom commands. One to teleport you to "Spawn" that the world operators have marker with a custom entity, and an other command to teleport your self back to your respawn point. There is as well a TP Menu *(teleportation menu)*, that allows you to send tp requests to other players asking them if you are allowed to teleport to them. *(tpr - tpa system)*

# Custom Commands Information
  | **Command** | **Description** |
  | :---: | :--- |
  | `tpi.item` | Gives you the TP Menu used for sending and recieving tp requests to and from other players online |
  | `tpi.bed` | Teleports you to your respawn point by using end portals |
  | `tpi.spawn` | Teleports you to the location that has been set as the "Spawn" by world operators using an entity marker |

# Marking down "Spawn" and respawn point warp
  To mark down the location where `tpi.spawn` should teleport to, you have to summon the spawn marker entity using ``/summon tpi:spawn`` on that location. To make `tpi.bed` work. Teleport your self to the end dimension and summon the marker entity using ``/summon tpi:bed`` somewhere in the end, preferably somewhere, where normal players can access. So secure that location with deny blocks too. 

# TP Menu Information

  To make the TP Menu UI appear, you right-click/use the TP Menu item. You will be greeted with 3 options:

### Send out a TP Request:
  Allows you to select a specific player that is online at the moment and send them a request so you can teleport to them.

### Your outgoing request:
  Here will appear the TP Request that you have send to an other player. You can have only one outgoing request at a time. Since have multiple doesn't have any use, you can only be at one location at a time. And like that others can't spam you with tp requests as easily.

### Manage incoming requests:
  Here go the TP requests that other players send to you, you can chose which to deny and to accept. When accepted, that player will teleport to you.
