# Teleportation Items
  [<img src="https://github.com/DeathSinger4221/Deaths-McBe-Packs/blob/main/thumbnails/tpItems.png?raw=true" width="600">]()

  This is a behavior pack that adds  a **TP Menu** *(teleportation menu)* that allows you to send tp requests to other players asking them if you are allowed to teleport to them. *(tpr - tpa system)*, and adds a marker system for world admins to mark down important locations to which anyone can teleport to! Some markers can be set to admin only as well!

# TP Menu
  [<img src="https://github.com/DeathSinger4221/Deaths-McBe-Packs/assets/115075789/3bd74f85-d9d5-4652-b207-03a7771b5d23" width="500">]()

  To make the TP Menu UI appear, you right-click/use the **TP Menu** item. *(Can be found in the Nature Section of the Creative Menu)*

### Send out a TP Request
  Allows you to select a specific player that is online at the moment and send them a request so you can teleport to them.

### Your outgoing request
  Here will appear the TP Request that you have send to an other player. You can only have one outgoing request at a time. Since having multiple doesn't have any use, you can only be at one location at a time. And that as well prevents players from sending requests to eveyone.

### Manage incoming requests
  Here go the TP requests that other players send to you, you can chose which to deny and to accept. When accepted, that player will **teleport to you.**

### TP to a Marker
  Here every marker that is set in the world and that you have permission to teleport to, will be listed and you will be teleported to the selected marker.

### TP to Respawnpoint
  This will teleport you to your respawnpoint, but if none present it will teleport you to the worldspawnpoint.

### Manage Markers
  Here you can set, remove and move Markers but you need the `tpiManager` tag *(Tag can be changed in the config file)* to unlock the **Manage Markers** button in the TP Menu as shown below.

  When clicked, it will list you every marker possible *(Every marker type can be changed or you can create new markers in the config file)* and indicate if the marker has been set or not in the world. Once you selected a marker, if it existed, you can move or remove it, else you can set it in the world.
