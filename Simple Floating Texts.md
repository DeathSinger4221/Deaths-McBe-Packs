# Information
</div>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This pack uses entities for the floating texts. So they are susceptible to the `/kill` command. The pack uses the `minecraft:egg` projectile entity as its base, but it does not interfere with the way the vanilla egg projectile functions, it justs uses the same entity.

> [!TIP]
> If your texts are being removed/killed, check for any /kill command blocks and add an exception for the `minecraft:egg` entity.

# **Floating Text Menu**
  To make the Floating Text Menu UI appear, you right-click/use the **Floating Text Menu** item.\
  *(Can be found in the Equipment Section of the Creative Menu)*

  * ### Persistant Player Names
    This pack stores each player's name inside a data base so it can show their name on the flaoting scoreboard even if the player is offline, instead of showing the text "Offline Player".
> [!NOTE]
> Some players might still get displayed as "Offline Player", they simply just need to join the world again to update the database.
