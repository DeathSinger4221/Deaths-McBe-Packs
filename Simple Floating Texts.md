# **Simple Floating Texts**
  [<img src="https://github.com/DeathSinger4221/Deaths-McBe-Packs/raw/main/thumbnails/floatingTexts.png?raw=true" width="700">]()

  A **simple** behavior pack that adds a **Floating Text Menu**, **Floating Texts** and **Floating Scoreboards** to your game. Using the menu you can place new texts and manage existing ones that are in loaded chunks.

  `No experimental toggles needed!`

# **Floating Text Menu**

  To make the Floating Text Menu UI appear, you right-click/use the **Floating Text Menu** item which can be found in the creative menu under the Nature tab. You will be greeted with 3 options:

## 1. New Floating Text

  Here you enter the text that should be displayed and its position in the world. When you submit, it will summon a new Floating Text using the given information.

  Note: You can use `\n` to have multiline floating texts.
  
  Example: `"Welcome to\nGitHub!"`

## 2. New Floating Scoreboard

  Here you have settings on how to display the scoreboard, which scoreboard to display and where it should be summoned.

## 3. Edit Loaded Texts
  [<img src="https://github.com/DeathSinger4221/Deaths-McBe-Packs/assets/115075789/ffbed7c3-a9fe-451c-aa89-0f141502eb49" width="500">]()

  Here you can find every loaded floating text and scoreboard and manage it by changing the displayed text, changing the text's location, changing any other parameter or entirely removing the floating entity.

# Imporatant
  This pack uses entities for the floating texts. So they are susceptible to the `/kill` command. The pack uses the `minecraft:egg` projectile entity as its base, but it does not interfere with the way the vanilla egg projectile functions, it justs uses the same entity.
  So if your texts are being removed/killed, check for any /kill command blocks and add a `[type=!minecraft:egg]`
